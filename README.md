## üìä Expected Data Format

The tools expect PHANGS FITS files with naming convention:

```
hlsp_phangs-hst_hst_wfc3-uvis_ngc4535_f275w_v1_exp-drc-sci.fits
```

**Required File Types:**

- `exp-drc-sci` - Science data (primary)
- `drc` - Drizzle-corrected images (alternative)

**Supported Filters:**

- **F275W** - Near-UV (275 nm)
- **F336W** - U-band (336 nm)
- **F438W** - B-band (438 nm)
- **F555W** - V-band (555 nm)
- **F814W** - I-band (814 nm)

## üé® Output Examples

### UV-V-I Composite (Recommended)

```bash
python perfect_uv_v_i_creator.py ngc4535
```

**Creates:**

- `ngc4535_UV_V_I_clean_perfected.png` - Your preferred clean style
- `ngc4535_UV_V_I_clean_LARGE.png` - Extra high-resolution version
- `ngc4535_UV_V_I_comparison.png` - Multiple processing styles

**Scientific Value:**

- **Red (UV)**: Star formation regions and hot young stars
- **Green (V)**: Overall stellar distribution and galaxy structure
- **Blue (I)**: Older stellar populations and dust penetration

### Alternative Combinations

- **B-V-I**: Classical optical imaging for stellar populations
- **U-B-V**: Traditional color photography equivalent
- **UV-U-B**: Star formation emphasis

## üî¨ Scientific Background

### Why These Filter Combinations Work

**UV-V-I Combination:**

- Spans ~540 nm wavelength range (275-814 nm)
- Maximum contrast between star formation and stellar structure
- Excellent for studying spiral galaxy evolution
- Relates to recent discoveries of ancient barred spirals

**B-V-I Combination:**

- Traditional optical astronomy standard
- Optimal for stellar population analysis
- Good dust lane visibility
- Comparable to classical photographic plates

### Connection to Recent Research

This project was inspired by recent discoveries of ancient barred spiral galaxies:

- **J0107a** - 11.1 billion year old barred spiral discovered by ALMA
- **Event Horizon Telescope** - Multi-wavelength black hole imaging
- **JWST discoveries** - Early galaxy structure formation

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start Simple:**

   ```bash
   python simple_galaxy_viewer.py /path/to/fits/directory
   ```

2. **Explore Options:**

   ```bash
   python improved_galaxy_composer.py /path/to/fits/directory
   ```

3. **Create Masterpiece:**
   ```bash
   python perfect_uv_v_i_creator.py /path/to/fits/directory
   ```

### Command Line Arguments

All scripts take a single argument - the directory containing FITS files:

```bash
python script_name.py /path/to/fits/files
```

### Output Files

**High-Resolution Images:**

- 300 DPI PNG format
- Black backgrounds (professional astronomy style)
- Multiple size options (standard and LARGE versions)

**Comparison Charts:**

- Multiple processing methods side-by-side
- White backgrounds for presentations
- Lower resolution for quick viewing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Processing

The tools include several adjustable parameters:

**Stretching Methods:**

- `zscale` - Percentile-based (recommended for clean results)
- `asinh` - Hyperbolic arcsine (handles wide dynamic range)
- `gamma` - Power law (good for enhancement)

**Color Balance:**

- `auto` - Statistical balancing
- `manual` - Preset weights for each filter

**Enhancement Options:**

- `unsharp_strength` - Detail enhancement (0.0-0.5 recommended)
- `saturation` - Color intensity (1.0-1.5 range)
- `brightness` - Overall brightness (0.8-1.2 range)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No PHANGS FITS files found"**

- Check file naming convention
- Ensure files end in `.fits`
- Verify directory path

**"No science images found"**

- Look for files containing `drc` or `sci` in filename
- Check FITS file extensions (should be 1 or 0)

**Display errors/Tkinter issues**

- Tools save files regardless of display issues
- Check for saved PNG files in working directory
- Use `perfect_uv_v_i_creator.py` which avoids display problems

**Memory issues with large files**

- 7000x7000 pixel images require ~400MB RAM per filter
- Close other applications if needed
- Tools automatically manage memory by closing figures

### Performance Tips

- Start with `simple_galaxy_viewer.py` to verify data loads correctly
- Use `perfect_uv_v_i_creator.py` for final high-quality outputs
- Multiple filters will take 2-5 minutes to process
- High-resolution saves may take 30-60 seconds each

## üåü Best Practices

### For Publication-Quality Results

1. **Use clean processing:** Start with clean, conservative settings
2. **Focus on UV-V-I:** This combination provides the best scientific story
3. **Save multiple versions:** Keep both standard and LARGE outputs
4. **Check individual filters:** Verify each filter loaded correctly
5. **Document your process:** Note which settings produced best results

### Scientific Considerations

- **UV data is noisier:** Tools automatically handle this with specialized stretching
- **Color balance matters:** Automatic balancing usually works best
- **Structure vs. aesthetics:** Clean versions are better for scientific analysis
- **File sizes:** High-resolution outputs can be 50-100MB each
